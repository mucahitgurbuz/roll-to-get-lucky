# Design Principles

The purpose of this project is creating simple and easy front-end answer to needs that coming from design requirements and business values. We created prenciples for this purpose.

**Simplicity:** Strive to keep the component API fairly simple and show real world scenarios of using the component.

**Naming Props:** We all know naming is the hardest thing in this industry. Generally, ensure a prop name is indicative of what it does. Boolean props should be named using auxilliary verbs such as does, has, is and should. For example, Button uses isDisabled, isLoading, etc.

**Composition:** Break down components into smaller parts with minimal props to keep complexity low, and compose them together. This will ensure that the styles and functionality are flexible and extensible. Atomic design principles applied for this purpose.
